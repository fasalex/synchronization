Additional notes to be considered :

speed 
algorithm 
gain 
initial values
number 
type of mobility 
alpha 

Dependencies 
period * numb
set of parameters for initial values 
what is losin a node mean ?

Limitations and assumptions 
	shadowing and fading not included 
	input values random 
	slot synchronization factors not included

Results 
	Median algorithm is stable as seen in most cases
	abrupt changes disturb the results - taking out of synchronization
	slow synch with speeds 

Discussion and Recommendations
	periodically perioding
	correlating with a predefined value to tackle the deviation
